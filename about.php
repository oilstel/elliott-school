                    <h2>Introduction</h2>

                    <p>Building websites has become complex but the fundamental languages behind the web have stayed pretty much the same. In this course, we will learn <span class="html">HTML</span>, the scaffolding behind all websites; <span class="css">CSS</span>, the presentation layer that gives our websites a unique identity and gracefully falls away when needed; and <span class="js">JavaScript</span>, the energy behind the modern web.</p>

                    <h2>Approaches</h2>

                    <p>In this course we will look at past and current methods of designing and building websites. Through workshops and assignments we utilize built-in design features of the web, practice making websites that feel grounded in the medium of the Internet, and discuss/critique the current state of the web.
                        
                    <p>Each assignment will be approached through a historical lens. Knowing your sources and building on what has become before is a crucial to any artistic medium. This is especially true when designing for the web. We will utilize the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine as a research tool and it is expected that you collect relavant sources before beginning each assignment. While current sources can be useful, it is more important to reference a technology or website from the past than a current trend. For example, if you are creating a website for sharing links with a small community of friends you could reference a project like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Memory">Community Memory</a>, 1973.</p>
