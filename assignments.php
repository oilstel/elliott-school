                        <h2>Assignment 1: HTML Profile</h2>
    
                        <p><em>HTML, CSS, writing on the web</em></p>

                        <p>Customize the HTML profile that we cloned from <a href="">this repo</a href="">. You should only change the content of your profile. Don't alter the design or it. We want to keep the profiles consistent to create our own class social network. Browse all <a href="">our profiles here</a> and find a piece of writing that interests you. Create a new comment/entry on your profile referencing a fellow student's writing. Keep the writing positive and add a link back to their profile.</p>

                        <p>Use the blockquote element to reference another profile...</p>
                        
                        <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;Fellow student's writing...&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code>

                        <h2>Assignment 2: Calendar</h2>
    
                        <p><em>CSS, grid layout, time-based website</em></p>
        
                        <p>Create a calendar using CSS grid. Play around with different grid layouts to make it flexible to the browser's width. Style your calendar and add at least three past events as subpages. These subpages should link back to the calendar. It's up to you what lives on these pages. You can post writing, images, video, or sound. If you are ambitious, you could try to use your calendar as a social media replacement. Your calendar will grow over the course of the semester as you learn more coding!</p>

                        <h3>A successful calendar should address these questions...</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li>How will users know that an event falls on a particular day? You could convey this through basic HTML or CSS pseudo-elements like ::before or ::after. Experiment with CSS shapes. Please don't use images as icons.</li>
                            <li>The calendar should use Grid and only scroll on the Y axis. How can you structure your grid layout using repeat and minmax so that it works seamlessly on desktop and mobile?</li>
                        </ul>
        
                        <p>By the end of the course your calendar should have at least 30 subpages.</p>

                        <h2>Assignment 3: 2 Screens</h2>

                        <p><em>HTML, CSS Media Queries</em></p>

                        <p>Create a website that displays different content when viewed on desktop and mobile. The user should have to browse your site on both devices at the same time to fully experience it.</p>

                        <p>Example: a website that displays images on mobile and text on desktop. Feel free to use this as a starting point but you are expected to go beyond this example.</p>
