In this course, we will learn <span class="html">HTML</span>, the scaffolding behind all websites; <span class="css">CSS</span>, the presentation layer that gives our websites a unique identity and gracefully falls away when needed; and <span class="js">JavaScript</span>, the energy behind modern websites.</p>
